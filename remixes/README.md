### James' Sturdy Case - https://github.com/JamesHagerman/fates3d_case

This case remix is held together with screws, nuts threaded onto the encoder shafts, and an internal bracket. It requires 17x 2.5m x 6mm threaded, hex head machine screws to fit together as well as 3 or 4 nuts for the encoder shafts depending on how many encoders you want to use. Test prints done in PLA on a Prusa i3 mk3s.
